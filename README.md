Overview

Using a web application based on Javascript and HTML to simulate WCDMA downlink signal for four users from a specified Node B.

Goals
Calculate the spreading factor required and the OVSF code used by each user.
Generate the CDMA downlink multiplexed signal.


Specifications
Using HTML
We used HTML to build a basic web application to get the data sequence and data rate for each user as input fields.
Using Javascript
After getting required information from the HTML page as inputs , we Calculate the spreading factor required and the OVSF code used by each user. Generate the CDMA downlink multiplexed signal , then plot it.
